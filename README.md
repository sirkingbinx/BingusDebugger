# BingusDebugger
This mod replaces the in-game Debug UI used by Another Axiom and allows you to do debugging, player inspection, log viewing, and anything else in-game.
You can navigate like this:
- Change Page: *Left Secondary* + *Right Thumbstick (left/right)*
- Change Page Mode (switch mods/players/etc.): *Left Thumbstick (up/down)*
